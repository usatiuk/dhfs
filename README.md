# Distributed Home File System 🚧

## What is this?

Inspired by Syncthing and Google Drive File Stream, this project
aspires to combine the best of them into one complete solution for
all the file synchronization needs: being decentralized like
Syncthing and allowing you to stream your files like Google Drive File Stream

## Run wrapper

[Download latest build](https://nightly.link/usatiuk/dhfs/workflows/server/main/Run%20wrapper.zip)

This is a simple wrapper around the jar/web ui distribution that allows you to run/stop
the DHFS server in the background, and update itself (hopefully!)

## How to use it?

### General prerequisites

Java should be available as `java` in path, and Java 21+ is required.

FUSE 2 userspace library also should be available:

- On Ubuntu `libfuse2` package can be installed.

- On Windows, [WinFsp](https://winfsp.dev/) should be installed. 

- On macOS, [macFUSE](https://macfuse.github.io/).

In the run-wrapper, 3 scripts are available.

- `run` script starts the filesystem
- `stop` script stops it
- `update` script will update the filesystem to the newest available CI build

On Windows, Powershell alternatives should be used. For them to work, it might be required to allow execution of unsigned scripts using `set-executionpolicy unrestricted`.

Additional options for the filesystem can be specified in the `extra-opts` file in the same directory with the run scripts.

One line in the `extra-opts` file corresponds to one option passed to the JVM when starting the filesystem. 

Some extra possible configuration options are:

- `-Ddhfs.fuse.root=` specifies the root where filesystem should be mounted. By default, it is the `fuse` path under the `run-wrapper` root. For windows, it should be a disk letter, by default `Z:\`.
- `-Ddhfs.objects.last-seen.timeout=` specifies the period of time (in seconds) after which unavailable peers will be ignored for gabgage collection and resynchronized after being reconnected. The default is 43200 (30 days), if set to `-1`, this feature is disabled.
- `-Ddhfs.objects.autosync.download-all=` specifies whether all objects (files and their data) should be downloaded to this peer. `true` or `false`, the default is `false`.

On Windows, the entire space for the filesystem should also be preallocated, the `-Ddhfs.objects.persistence.lmdb.size=` option controls the size (the value is in bytes), on Windows the default is 100 GB.

Then, a web interface will be available at `losthost:8080`, that can be used to connect with other peers.
